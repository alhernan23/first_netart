        <h1 class="title">VIDEO ART: the third of the saga</h1>
        <p>For our video art, we were to sync up our animation to our sound art. This was a challenge for me,
            not only because animation has always been something I struggled with but also because my sound
            art is just all over the place. It felt intimidating trying to brainstorm ideas. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After looking at some examples though, I had a better understanding that it was supposed to be an
            abtract animation. For things like this, you just have to not think about it and do whatever it feels like.
            I ended up coming up with the idea of this little square going on a journey to find a home (keeping it consistent
            with my friendship theme: my friends have always been my home).
        </p>

            I was mostly inspired by the “outernet” we saw in the film World of Tomorrow, I created about 62 frames in total, and 
            had them repeated multiple times to get a minute worth of content. It was pretty difficult: cutting individual pieces 
            of paper and taping it together, scanning each and every index card, getting enough frames and especially editing because 
            everything I have is playing at about 0.1 seconds to make it work a little smoother (and also I was just following a YouTube 
            tutorial for guidance on how to start). Working in Premiere Pro was really awkward because I haven't used the program before. 
            I constantly copied and pasted individual frames, played around with the speed/duration a lot, played with effects, etc. 
            But once I knew what I was doing (after watching a few YouTube tutorials), I kinda taught myself the rest and got into 
            the flow of things. The effects make the process and the video itself a lot more fun, so that was one of my favorite parts 
            of the animation process.
