        <h1 class="title">SOUND ART: the second of the saga</h1>
        <p>For our sound art, we were to use an audio recording from our phone, a recording from our computers,
            and 5 unique effects in Audacity. I used a video of some friends and me in junior year 
            of high school, and the song Citta Vuota (Italian for It's A Lonely Town). This song was
            used in the end credits of Pixar's movie Luca, which has friendship as one of its main themes.
            It was a great match for my theme of friendship, and I kept the theme consistent with my glitch art. 
            I fell in love  with the reverse effect as well as the wahwah and filter curve EQ, and
             really tried to distort the song and my audio to be super experimental. 
             It was a difficult process listening to it over and over again because 
             it didn't feel “melodic” or whatever, but that's a reminder that sound 
             art doesn't have to be music. It's supposed to be weird and experimental 
             and totally out of the loop compared to actual music.</p>
