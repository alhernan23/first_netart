        <h1 class="title">GLITCH ART: the first of the saga</h1>
        <p>For our glitch art we were to choose one image to glitch three times.
            To glitch our photos, they were put in the music program Audcaity,
            and we played with different effects. I did a lot of editing in Photoshop as well.
            I decided to add a theme as well
            to the project overall: friendship. My original photo was taken during 
            winter break when my high school friends and I got together to see the
            lights in Golden Gate Park.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first effect I used was reverse. We planned to use the bus to get to the other
            side of Golden Gate Park to see the lights, but one of us got one and immediately the 
            bus drove off. On an impulse my partner ran after the bus, tripping and falling in
            process. It was kind of a setback, or a "reverse." So the color is red to show the intense 
            emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second effect I used was echo. When we all got home, we texted each other
            just make sure everyone was ok so it was like an "echo." The feeling was sad, knowing
            I wouldn't see them in a while again so the color palette mostly consists of blue. 
            But I like to also think that blue represents a calm, satisifed feeling, showing
            how we were all happy to see each other, even just for a day.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last effect I used was slide. at the end of the day I texted my partner that 
            I wish we all had more time together because it was a pretty short hang out, 
            considering we haven't seen each other since August. I guess “sliding” can be a 
            reference for “moving on” in hopes that one day I get to see them soon again. 
            So the mood is more warm and hopeful.
